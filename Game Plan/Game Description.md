## Prerequesites: 
A terraria-like game. 
## Target: 
Become the right-hand of one of four gods of a player's choice.
## Gods:
* Bellum (God of War)  
  >- increases favor from attacking, 
  >- decreases favor from dying
* Praesidium (God of Protection)  
  >- increases favor from taking damage, 
  >- decreases favor from dying
* Eventum (God of Fortune)  
  >- increases favor from mining, dying, 
  >- decreases favor from sleeping
* Consilium (God of Wisdom)  
  >- increases favor from crafting, sleeping, 
  >- decreases favor from failed crafting skilltests, taking damage

Along its path the player can choose to perform actions that increase favor with one or more gods while, sometimes, loosing favor form the other one or more gods. At some point, when the player reaches certain favor with some gods, the player will recieve certain buffs (from favoured gods) and debuffs (from unfavored gods).
#### Ex (TODO: story context, additional buffs/debuffs ideas): 
* Bellum: high favor will yeld increased damage when attacking, low favor will yeld weakness
* Praesidium: high favor will yeld increased health, low favor will yeld lower damage resistance
* Eventum: high favor will yeld increased drop rates from mining/attacking, low favor will yeld increased monster spwan rate
* Consilium: high favor will easier crafting and higher chance of recieving back some of the used materials, low favor will increase the probabilty of failed crafting attempt 
### Mechanics:
