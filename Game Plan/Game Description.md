Along its path the player can choose to perform actions that increase favor with one or more gods while, sometimes, loosing favor form the other one or more gods. At some point, when the player reaches certain favor with some gods, the player will recieve certain buffs (from favoured gods) and debuffs (from unfavored gods).

The player assumes the role of a hero that will dethrone one of the four gods, and so the journey begins by choosing which god to oppose. Each God temple (location) is in a different corner of the world, and each one of them presents unique challenges that must be overcome to reach the god's throne.

#### Ex (TODO: story context, additional buffs/debuffs ideas): 

## Story Context
In a world filled with chaos and destruction, four powerful gods ruled over the land, each with their own unique look and abilities . But one day, a prophecy emerged, foretelling the arrival of a hero who would have the power to dethrone one of the gods and bring peace to the world. The hero has to defeat one of the gods, and thus, gain certain buffs that will help him defeat the other ones. 

1. To reach the temple (location) of Bellum, the player must battle their way through a series of enemies, proving their worth as a warrior before finally facing the god of war himself. To dethrone Bellum, the player must defeat him in a fierce battle, using their combat skills and the weapons and armor they have crafted along the way.

2. To reach the temple (location) of Praesedium, the player must navigate a fortress, filled obstacles designed to test their intelligence and problem-solving abilities. The battle with Praesedium is less about brute strength and more about careful strategy, as the god of protection is nearly invulnerable without first disabling his various defenses.

3. The temple (location) is located underground, in a vast network of mines and caves. To reach the god of fortune, the player must explore these tunnels, gathering resources and avoiding deadly hazards. The battle with Eventum is a test of endurance, as the god's high health pool and powerful attacks require the player to constantly be on the move and strike opportunistically.

4.   The temple (location) of Consilium is located in the clouds, accessible only by building a towering structure of blocks and platforms. Once there, the player must solve a series of crafting puzzles, demonstrating their mastery of the game's crafting mechanics. The battle with Consilium is a test of patience and precision, as the god of wisdom can only be defeated by exploiting his weaknesses and timing attacks just right.

Throughout the journey, the player will encounter various NPCs and quest-givers who offer valuable resources and information. They must also manage their resources carefully, crafting new weapons and armor to face tougher challenges and building safe havens to rest and recover.

Each of the four gods offers unique rewards and benefits for those who align themselves with them, but at a cost of permanent downsides for those who oppose them. The player must carefully weigh the pros and cons before choosing which path to take, and ultimately must defeat three of the four gods to unlock the final boss and bring peace to the world.

### Mechanics:
* Attack
* Place/Break blocks
